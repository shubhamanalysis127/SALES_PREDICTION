# Sales Prediction Project

This project aims to predict sales based on advertising spend across different media channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper).

## Overview

The project uses Python and popular data science libraries to:
- Load and explore advertising spend and sales data
- Visualize relationships between variables
- Build a linear regression model to predict sales
- Evaluate model performance
- Analyze residuals and model diagnostics

## Key Files

- `advertising.csv`: Dataset containing advertising spend and sales data
- `sales_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full analysis and code

## Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy  
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Model Performance

- R-squared Score: 0.82
- Mean Absolute Error: 1.86
- Root Mean Squared Error: 2.36

## Visualizations

The project includes several visualizations:
- Pairplot of features
- Correlation heatmap
- Actual vs Predicted Sales scatter plot
- Residual plot
- Distribution of residuals

## Future Work

- Experiment with feature engineering
- Try non-linear models
- Collect more data, especially for high-spend scenarios
